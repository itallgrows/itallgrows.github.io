	<h3>About:</h3>


	<p>It all grows started as an idea to see if one can grow vegetables and fruits in Kuwait. Where the summer is scorching hot. It began with growing tomatos when I found that they survived I immersed myself with all that is gardening. Now I give lectures and plan events to introduce gardening to the masses in Kuwait. As well I sell raised beds and organic compost that I make myself. So now you can grow your own organic garden.</p>
